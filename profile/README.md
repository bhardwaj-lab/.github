## Description

The Bhardwaj Lab is a part of the [Institute of Biodynamics and Biocomplexity](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/institute-of-biodynamics-and-biocomplexity) of Utrecht University. Our research goal is to combine high-throuhput genomics and machine learning to enable efficient cell fate programming. We build new bioinformatic methods and tools to analyse the data from quantitative genomics technologies.
